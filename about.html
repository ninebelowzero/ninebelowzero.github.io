## About

I'm a web developer who's obsessed with languages (human and otherwise) and the things you can write with them. I'm a big fan of Ruby and have a complicated relationship with JavaScript. I'm dying to get to know the cool kids - Scala, Erlang, Clojure and the gang.

In my previous life, I was a financial journalist and China specialist. I love literature, but suffer from [Tsundoku](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A9%8D%E3%82%93%E8%AA%AD) - the compulsive habit of buying books faster than I can read them. My obsession with 1940s detective novels is rivalled only by my obsession with Bob Dylan.
