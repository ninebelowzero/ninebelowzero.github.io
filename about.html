## About

I’m a financial journalist, linguist and China specialist who’s discovered the joy of coding and can never go back. Fresh out of web development bootcamp, I’m in love with Ruby and have a complicated relationship with JavaScript. I'm enjoying getting to know Python and the Cs.

In my spare time I write short stories and sometimes poems; currently halfway through a novel set in Cambridge in the 1930s and ‘40s. I love literature, but suffer from Tsundoku - the compulsive habit of buying books faster than I can read them.
