## About

I'm a web developer who's obsessed with languages (human and otherwise) and the things you can write with them. I'm a big fan of Ruby and have a complicated relationship with JavaScript. I'm enjoying getting to know Python and the C's.

In my previous life, I was a financial journalist and China specialist. Outside of coding, my favourite things are books and blues (and books about the blues). Unfortunately I suffer from [Tsundoku](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A9%8D%E3%82%93%E8%AA%AD) - the compulsive habit of buying books faster than I can read them.

I'm starting a blog about code; I'll try to stick to the point, but it can only be only a matter of time before I get drunk and start raving about Bob Dylan. You've been warned.
