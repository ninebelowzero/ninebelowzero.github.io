## About

I’m a financial journalist, linguist and China specialist who’s discovered the joy of coding and can never go back. Fresh out of web development bootcamp, I’m in love with Ruby and have a complicated relationship with JavaScript. I'm enjoying getting to know Python and the Cs.

In my spare time I write short stories and sometimes poems; I'm currently halfway through a novel. I love literature, but suffer from [Tsundoku](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A9%8D%E3%82%93%E8%AA%AD) - the compulsive habit of buying books faster than I can read them.

I'm starting a blog about code; I'll try to stick to the point, but it can only be only a matter of time before I get drunk and start raving about Bob Dylan. You've been warned.
